# Model Context Protocol (MCP) - An Introduction

## Basic Understanding

**Definition:** MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how your **LLM applications** connect to and work with your **tools & data sources.**

> So the idea here is to not reinvent the wheel like how we use tools etc, but to standardize the way our AI Applications connect with data sources.

**Other previously existing concepts:**

- **REST APIs:** Standardizes how **web applications** interact with the **backend**.
- **LSP (Language Server Protocol):** Standardizes how **IDEs** interact with language-specific tools.
- **MCP:** Standardizes how **AI applications** interact with **external systems**.

> Interestingly, **anything that can be done using MCP can also be done without MCP**. The only aim of this is to have a common umbrella (we use the word 'standardize') for our AI Applications to interact with external sources.

> So instead of creating different connections each time to different sources from our application (like how we did with APIs), we build this i.e. MCP, once and connect anywhere.

**Q. How is using an MCP Server different from just calling a service's API directly?**

A. MCP Servers do seem very similar to working with APIs (and that's not totally wrong if you think about it). We can instead see it as a gateway/wrapper that is built on top of an API. So if you don't want to bother calling the API directly, you can just ask in natural language and the MCP server will handle that for you.

**Q. Sounds like MCP Servers and tool use are the same thing?**

A. MCP Servers provide tool schemas + functions already defined for you.

## MCP Architecture

MCP is essentially a Client-Server Architecture. The following two slides show this well.

        style="border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"
    >
</div>

<div align="center">
    <img 
        src="/post-images/model-context-protocol/mcp-arch-2.png" 
        alt="Working of Client-Server Architecture" 
        width="80%" 
        style="border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"
    >
</div>

In the second image above, we can see three different functionalities which MCP offers: Tools, Resources and Prompt Templates. So how do we utilize them?

1. **Defining a Tool**
    - MCP provides SDKs for building servers and clients in a variety of languages.
    - One such is the Python MCP SDK; it makes it very easy to declare tools.

    **Code that can be written in the MCP Server:**

    ```
    @mcp.tool()
    def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
        """
        Args:
            a: First number to add
            b: Second number to add

        Returns:
            The sum of the two numbers
        """
        return a + b
    ```

2. **Resources**
    - Allows the MCP Server to expose data to the client (These are similar to GET request handlers in a typical HTTP server).
    - There are two types: **Direct and Templated**.
    - Can return any type of data including Strings, JSON, Binary etc. For example: We set `mime_type` to give the client a hint as to what data will be returned.

    **Code that can be written in the MCP Server:**

    Direct Resource:
    ```
    @mcp.resource(
        "docs://documents",
        mime_type="application/json"
    )
    def list_docs():
        # Return list of document names
    ```

    Templated:
    ```
    @mcp.resource(
        "docs://documents/{doc_id}",
        mime_type="text/plain"
    )
    def fetch_doc(doc_id: str):
        # Return the contents of a doc
    ```

    Below shows the two ways. In direct we specifically choose the file we need via `@`, but in template we simply mention it as part of the prompt and it is sent to the client. The application then decides whether it needs to take that data or not (Rather than having a tool call first to take the data, then pass it to the prompt and then send).

    <div align="center">
    <img src="/post-images/model-context-protocol/mcp-resources.png" alt="Working of Client-Server Architecture" width="80%" style="border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
    </div>

3. **Prompts**
    - Defines a set of messages which can be used by the client. These should be of high quality and must be well tested.

    **Code that can be written in the MCP Server:**

    ```
    @mcp.prompt(
        name="format",
        description="Rewrites contents of a document in Markdown format",
    )
    def format_document(doc_id: str) -> list[base.Message]:
        # Return a list of messages
    ```

## Communication in MCP

The image below depicts the typical communication lifecycle between MCP servers and clients.

<div align="center">
    <img 
        src="/post-images/model-context-protocol/communication-lifecycle.png" 
        alt="Communication Lifecycle" 
        width="80%" 
        style="border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"
    >
</div>

It is important to understand the steps here as these will be seen in code as well.

- In Step 1, there is initialization from both ends and it finally ends with a notification of approval.
- In Step 2, although it's not seen in the image, there is communication both ways (between Server and Client) and there are also two-way notification approvals between them as well.
- Finally, Step 3 is where the termination of this entire lifecycle happens.

**Q. How are the messages being sent and received between the client and server?**

A. **MCP Transports.** A transport handles the underlying mechanics of how messages are sent and received between the client and server.

There are types for this as well depending on where the servers are running:

- Local servers: `stdio`
- Remote servers: `HTTP+SSE (Server Sent Events)` or `Streamable HTTP`.

        alt="Local Connection" 
        width="80%" 
        style="border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"
    >
</div>

<div align="center">
    <img 
        src="/post-images/model-context-protocol/remote-connections.png" 
        alt="Remote Connection" 
        width="80%" 
        style="border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"
    >
</div>

<div align="center">
    <img 
        src="/post-images/model-context-protocol/stateless-connection.png" 
        alt="Stateless Connection" 
        width="80%" 
        style="border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"
    >
</div>

> Streamable HTTP will be the standard protocol which will be used going forward as stateless connections are much preferred.
